    summary:
      "We designed and developed a custom website for Zachary Knight Enterprises, an Indigenous consulting company dedicated to supporting Indigenous communities across Canada and the United States. The site was built to clearly communicate their wide range of services — from assisting with funding applications to managing complex housing projects and delivering training for housing staff. A key focus was highlighting their innovative “Inspector in a Box” program, a unique solution that builds housing capacity in Indigenous communities. We also created dedicated space to honour the Zachary Knight Memorial Scholarship, launching in June 2026, which supports Indigenous youth pursuing post-secondary education in housing, infrastructure, or community development. This project was rooted in purpose and meaning, reflecting the organization’s mission and the legacy of Zachary Knight.",
