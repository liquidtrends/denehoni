              Weâ€™re an Indigenous-owned creative and strategic studio offering full-service, relationally grounded support in web development,
              graphic design, communications, and strategic planning.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Every project begins with listening. Every story is rooted in truth. And every solution is tailored to honour the unique voices, cultures,
              and visions of the Indigenous communities we serve.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
              We also collaborate with non-Indigenous clients who are committed to respectful, values-aligned engagement and seek to integrate Indigenous
              perspectives, design, or storytelling into their work with care and integrity.
